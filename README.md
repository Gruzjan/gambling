# Gambling

A little addon for keydrop that sums a case's odds for you.
Currently works only for polish language and PLN currency. Didn't check if it works for other options.

## TODO:
Some cool ideas how I can upgrade this addon.
- Multi language/currency support (because apperently when you change your language price formatting changes too)
- Addon's site with client-sided db with case name, it's odds, and last check date. All this with sorting, filters etc.
- Maybe some price to highest win value ratio? idk
